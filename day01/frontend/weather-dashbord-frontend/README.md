# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- **React** (Frontend)

  - Built a weather dashboard that allows users to search for a city and display the weather.

  ### **Features:**

- Users can search for a city by name in the search bar.
- The weather for that city is displayed, including temperature, conditions, and more.
- The weather data is stored in an AWS S3 bucket for persistent storage.
